## Red Teamer
**Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organisation and providing feedback from an enemies perspective**

Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

### Responsibilities
Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
